Work on the code now stored in Catwalk was begun in 2016 at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago.

Most of the original work by the authors was made in the [triage](https://github.com/dssg/triage) repository, and later moved here. This removed the original attributions; here is an alphabetical list of the contributors to the pre-imported code.

Klaus Ackermann
Tristan Crockett
Andrea Navarrete
